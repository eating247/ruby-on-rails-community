## What is this community for?

This is a space where women (including trans and nonbinary folks) can come together and help each other learn and understand web development. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting. There's always at least one mentor/leader present to help you with best practices or to guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem! 

Every regular meetup will have the following format:

* 6:30pm - Setup and start working
* 7:00pm - Quick Introductions 
* 7:15pm - Talk (if scheduled)
* 8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up 

We want a majority of the night to be open for people to code and learn. If you are a first timer to coding or ROR we have suggested courses you can follow and encourage you to ask lots and lots of questions. Note that the first week of the month is especially for "first-timers". We will focus on providing extra support to those new to coding.

For those who are more familiar with the language we encourage you to bring in projects that you are working on and also ask questions. I want to emphasize ASKING QUESTIONS! We want to build a community of awesome Rails devs and that requires sharing ideas and knowledge! We ask that you pleaaaaasee do not bring in or ask questions about work because they can be domain specific and not always constructive.

Anyone should feel free to suggest talk topics or volunteer to deliver one.

All events for Women Who Code DC are scheduled on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/).

## What if I'm a first timer that's never coded before?
Check out our [Rails guide](rails_guide.md) for first timers, that contains information on Ruby, Rails, text editors, and more! Go through the recommended resources and feel free to ask lots of questions.

You can also ask questions in the Women Who Code DC `#ruby-on-rails` Slack channel, or chat about topics like git and mentorship (among others) in our other channels. [Sign up](bit.ly/wwcdcslack) to request access.

## What if I'm a web development pro?

We encourage you to attend the group, particularly on open lab or hack nights. You could work on a personal project, take one of the recommended courses to further your skills, help others with questions they might have, consider doing a lighting/tech talk, or consider being a lead! Women Who Code DC is also a great place to try out a conference talk you're giving for the first time.

### Lightning Talk Possible Topics

* Present an app you're working on
* MVC
* Rails vs. Django (or any other framework)
* Ruby vs. any other language
* Networking/Internet Technologies

## What resources do you suggest?

We've got a list of resources in our [Rails guide](rails_guide.md), but you can [jump right to the resources](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/ruby-on-rails-community/blob/master/rails_guide.md#suggested-learning-tools) if you like. We check periodically to make sure the links work and things are up to date, but if you have something to add, feel free to submit a PR or open an issue.

## What do leads do?

Leads are present to facilitate the study group. They communicate with hosts, schedule meetups, come up with curriculum, and are also available to ask questions.

## Can I be a lead?

YES! We are always looking for more leads and if you're interested in getting involved in Women Who Code in any capacity talk to one of the leads present!

## How can I contribute without being a lead?

We need lots of help coordinating events. If you want to help out please let us know :)

## Slack
The WWC-DC community uses Slack to keep in touch, share resources, and chat about all things tech. You can use Slack to ask troubleshooting questions or general questions about coding (in any language) and the tech industry. We encourage you to sign up here: http://bitly.com/womenwhocodedcslack (and read our guide if you're new to Slack: http://bit.ly/slackguide)

## Building Access

Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted. Please respect the policy, in case the location requires access to the building contact the group lead if information is provided, or drop a comment on the meetup page. We'll come and get you.
